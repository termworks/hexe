--
--   local hexe = load(src)(my_transport)
--   local mux  = hexe.connect()
--   for _, pane in ipairs(mux.panes()) do print(pane.name, pane.cwd) end
--
-- Three ways to get `src`, and a sandboxed host can only use the first two: the `client` verb on
-- an already-open connection, a sibling's own stub (the framing and reply shape are shared), or
-- `io.popen("hexe lua-api"):read("a")` where the host permits `io`.
--
-- Plain Lua on purpose. It runs unchanged in hexe's own VM, in oslo's, in PUC Lua and in whatever
-- the next sibling embeds, so it is *copied* between tools rather than ported — and a fix to the
-- framing reaches every one of them. It is a sibling of oslo's `client.lua` and deliberately the
-- same shape; read that one and this one holds no surprises.
--
-- The only thing it cannot do itself is open a socket. That arrives as the chunk's argument:
--
--   load(src)(transport)     transport.connect(path, timeout_ms) -> handle
--                            handle:send(bytes) / handle:recv(n) / handle:close()
--
-- Inside hexe that is `hexe.stream`, and it is found automatically when nothing is passed.
--
-- **The surface is small on purpose.** It is not a mirror of `hexe.live`; it is the handful of
-- things another program has a real reason to ask a mux, and every one answers a question the
-- asker cannot answer for itself — a pane list scraped from CLI output is a guess, this is not.
--
-- What a session will actually let you do is decided at the far end, per call, by the access the
-- caller was granted (see docs/access.md). This file describes the vocabulary; it does not grant
-- anything.
